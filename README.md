# pedestrian_flow_counter

This is a simple example to show you how to count the flow of pedestrian by opencv.
Since this algorithm rely on tracking algorithm, we can expect the limitation of
tracking algorithms apply on it too.

Limitation of this project

1 : Camera must be fixed
2 : Occlusion
3 : Crowded scenes
4 : Object cannot move too fast
5 : Frame rate cannot be too low and need to be stable

Although there are many limitations, I think this is still a good start for pedestrian flow counter.
